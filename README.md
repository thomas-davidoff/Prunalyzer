# Prunalyzer
 This program is a personal python project, aiming to parse, analyze, and present insights on game data from Prosperous Universe.
 The end goal would be to create a standalone web-based app that users can use to 
 
 Features:
  - Fetches relevant game data from FIO REST API
  - Parses fetched data into collections of Python objects, which are searchable by keyword (material/building ticker)
  - Organizes and exports data for materials, buildings, recipes, inventory into excel file

 Future features (to-do):
  - Inventory Tracking (calculate material burn rate, create inventory graphs; use to schedule cargo-transfer flights/sales)
  - 	Organize user production queues, and set production schedule
  - 	Allow user to experiment with production by changing schedules and seeing impact on financials
  - Analyze price data across commodity exchanges to calculate the collective 'buying' power of each currency
